# Stable Diffusion Model Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation and usage of a Stable Diffusion model. 
The project is designed for text-to-image generation using state-of-the-art techniques in deep learning.

## Features

- **End-to-End Workflow**: From data preparation to model evaluation and visualization.
- **Customizable Configurations**: Easily modify parameters to experiment with different settings.
- **High-Quality Outputs**: Generate images with exceptional detail and coherence from textual descriptions.

## Requirements

The notebook requires the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: PyTorch, transformers, diffusers, PIL, numpy, matplotlib (installable via `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook using the command:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Stable_DiffusionModel.ipynb
   ```
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to configure and run the model.

## Outputs

Generated images will be saved in the `outputs/` directory. Visualizations are embedded directly in the notebook.

## Notes

This project leverages pre-trained Stable Diffusion models from popular libraries such as `diffusers`. 
Ensure you have adequate GPU resources for optimal performance.
